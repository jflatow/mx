mx
===

A single file containing syntactic sugar to turn `m4` into a simple templating framework.
The main thing is to make template "inheritance" easy.

This can be done with `mx` e.g.::

   ...
   mx_def `VAR1',
    ...
   mx_end
   ...
   mx_def `VARN',
    ...
   mx_end
   ...
   mx_inc(base)
   ...

`base` could look something like this::

   ...
   mx_strip(VAR1)
   ...
   mx_strip(VAR2)
   ...

Or whatever.

To invoke::

   m4 -P mx.m4 ...

.. note:: Requires `m4` be called with the `-P` option

See the `mx` script for an example invocation wrapper.
See the `tests` dir for examples of usage.
